This program will do the following:

recurvively cycle through all files in the target directory and subdirectories

open logfile

touch > logfile

find - name | convert(name)

Now call python script to do the following:

summarise and group converted files as follows:

artist, album - converted or unconverted

write summary of actions to file and output to terminal.

Option - rsynch with remote music folder - similar log funtion.

Develop as follows:

(a) first emphasise file reading and writing functions.
(b) 


function convert(name):
{
    if file type is ALAC:
        {
        convert to FLAC
        converted status = TRUE
        logfile(name,converted status)
        } 

    if file type is AIFF:
        {
        convert to FLAC
        converted status = TRUE
        logfile(name,converted status
        }


    if file type is WAV:
        {
        convert to FLAC
        log as follows:

        write tags (can this be done with WAV)
        converted status = TRUE
        logfile(name,converted status)
        }

    if file type is MP3 OR AAC:
        {
        log as follows:
        do not convert,artistname,albumtitle,songtitle,type >> logfile
        }
}

function logfile(name, converted status:
{
    converted status,artistname,albumtitle,songtitle,type    >> logfile
}
