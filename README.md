# myMediaProjects
## Learning BASH and scripting while playing with my media files. Maybe some python too...

This is a self training exercise, building on what I learned in my first semester in GMIT, 
and also building on half-understood mini-projects previously implemented at home.

The aim of this project will be to:


(1)
Read all my media files (file . -name

If filetype == AAC or mp3, do not convert, but log in a csv file

If filetype == ALAC, convert to FLAC. Log converted files

(2) 

Synch with external hard drive (connected with OMSC device) (rsynch)

(3)

Later version will add movie files

(4)

Using python data reporting tools

Method:

write in natural language and psuedocode
